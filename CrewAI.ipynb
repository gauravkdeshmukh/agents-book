      "1. **Short-Term Goals:**\n",
      "   - Build an emergency fund that covers 3-6 months of living expenses.\n",
      "   - Save for a vacation or large purchase within the next 1-2 years.\n",
      "\n",

      "**Recommended Investment Options:**\n",

      "   - **High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA):**\n",
      "     - **Potential Risks:** Very low risk. The primary risk is that the interest rates can fluctuate.\n",
      "     - **Potential Returns:** Typically higher than traditional savings accounts, around 0.5%-1.5% APY.\n",
      "     - **Overview:** This is essential for liquidity and safety. It ensures that the user has quick access to funds in case of emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Short-Term Investments (1-2 years):**\n",
      "   - **Certificates of Deposit (CDs):**\n",
      "     - **Potential Risks:** Low risk, but there might be penalties for early withdrawal.\n",
      "     - **Potential Returns:** Fixed interest rates, typically higher than savings accounts, ranging from 1%-2.5% depending on the term.\n",
      "     - **Overview:** CDs offer a safe way to earn a bit more interest on funds that the user does not need immediate access to.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Medium-Term Investments (3-7 years):**\n",
      "   - **Bond Funds or ETFs:**\n",
      "     - **Potential Risks:** Moderate risk, subject to interest rate changes and credit risk.\n",
      "     - **Potential Returns:** Average returns range from 2%-5% annually.\n",
      "     - **Overview:** Bond funds or ETFs provide diversification and can offer a steady income stream. They are suitable for goals like saving for a down payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Long-Term Investments (7+ years):**\n",
      "   - **Stocks:**\n",
      "     - **Potential Risks:** High risk due to market volatility.\n",
      "     - **Potential Returns:** Historically, stocks have returned about 7%-10% annually over the long term.\n",
      "     - **Overview:** Investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks can provide significant growth over time. Consider using low-cost index funds or ETFs to diversify and minimize fees.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - **Mutual Funds or ETFs:**\n",
      "     - **Potential Risks:** Moderate to high risk, depending on the fund's composition.\n",
      "     - **Potential Returns:** Can vary widely, but equity funds often return 6%-10% annually over the long term.\n",

      "Market Dynamics:\n",
      "Driver: Increasing number of internet users and growing adoption of smart devices\n",
      "The IoT has gained much attention among residential consumers, given the advantages attained by connecting household products to the internet. Connecting products, software algorithms, and services with end users, and providing them with flowability, the IoT facilitates data smoothly, aiding in real-time decisions. It has shown its efficiency and enhanced the quality and consistency of the automation systems. That is why scale companies across the world are putting huge investments in the loT industry. It appears that traditional practices of most businesses are trending toward loT; hence, it would reach huge numbers of application areas, such as lighting, HVAC, security, healthcare, and entertainment.\n",
      "That is to say, the consumer shift towards video doorbells, voice-assisted technologies such as Alexa and Google Home, and surveillance systems is expected to drive the smart home market share. On the other hand, growth in consumer loT adoption is driven by the increasing penetration of the internet, growing usage of smartphones, and expansion of social network platforms. The growing internet users across the world are likely to increase the growth of the overall loT market, as there is a rise in the adoption rate of internet-enabled smart devices such as radio frequency identification, barcode scanners, and mobile computers.\n",
      "Restraint: Convenience-driven rather than necessity-driven market\n",
      "Smart homes provide convenience and sophisticated measures to operate a lot of electronic products in the household. These products are usually assumed to simplify daily activities rather than solve energy-efficiency issues. Many concerns are associated with the exclusivity of smart home technology. The technology is often viewed as a luxury, affordable only to some affluent stratum of society. These systems still have to make the homeowners realize the cost and energy savings they offer. To get complete home automation, the buyer has to further invest in displays, software, sensors, and analytical solutions. An average homeowner is often reluctant to learn the information and processes necessary for the installation and operation of hardware devices. Thus, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the system by the homeowner may affect the market negatively. Other than do-it-yourself DIY home automation solutions, in the case of appointment of service providers by the home owners to monitor and control smart home products on a contract basis, maintenance cost has to be paid every month or year that might not be afforded by an average homeowner. This acts as a restraining factor for the growth of the smart home market , mainly in regions like Asia Pacific and RoW Middle East, South America, and Africa, wherein the economies are still developing.\n",
      "Opportunity: Favorable government regulations to promote green buildings\n",
      "A green building is a structure that uses environmentally responsible and resource-efficient processes in order to reduce negative impacts on human health and the environment, which goes all the way from siting through design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition of a building's lifecycle. Significant methods of developing sustainable buildings incorporate specifications for:\n",
      "Local green building materials, reduction of loads, system optimization, and on-site renewable energy generation are some of the strategies. Buildings use up to 40% of total energy while GHG emissions are 30% of the global source of these gases, according to the United Nations Environment Program. For instance, in Hong Kong, building GHG emissions are nearly 70%. These facts demonstrate that sustainable development of buildings would massively help decrease the quantum of GHG emissions coming out from the construction industry into the atmosphere.\n",
      "Basically, any green building design balances homebuilding with a sustainable environment. Due to the reduction in the consumption of energy and proliferation of environmental wastes, the concept of green buildings has been supported by various initiatives across the globe. Although the number of new buildings is increasing yearly in Asia due to rapid urbanization, the low electricity prices of some Asian countries often do not encourage energy-saving practices in buildings. Under such circumstances, it is often the government that initiates building energy regulations to promote building energy efficiency. Building energy efficiency standards can be either mandatory or voluntary based on the country. For instance, countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam have mixed standards-that is, both mandatory and voluntary-while Singapore and Thailand have opted for mandatory regulations for energy conservation in their building energy performance requirements.\n",
      "Challenge: Difficulties in linking disparate systems, limited functionalities, and lack of open standards\n",
      "Currently, the smart home market share is fragmented, with competing manufacturers developing different smart home systems using various technologies. While it is easy to integrate devices from the same manufacturer or vendor, it is quite hard to integrate disparate systems offered by different manufacturers or vendors. It results in limited functionalities and unreliable services of devices from disparate vendors normally. Furthermore, most of the systems that are in the market have complex interfaces that prevent further expansion of the capabilities of smart home systems. On deployment, the lack of interoperability is a major obstacle to the acceptance of smart home technology solutions. Before consumers can have current home automation systems ready for use, they have to plough through a vast variety of wireless technologies in an attempt to find the products that best suit their needs and can coexist with the system that is already in place. Therefore, issues of hooking up disparate systems and the difficulty of integrating security systems are major challenges that smart home device and control manufacturers have to contend with. Due to this, smart home device manufacturers are instead focusing on developing open protocol devices with either BACnet or LonMark interoperability since these are the only open standard protocols for communication. However, in In this new world of convergence, interoperable systems that adhere to industry standards must be able to connect with other kinds of equipment, as easily done and integrated into the network. Interoperability from BACnet and LonMark alone is not enough to ensure complete enterprise information compatibility and interoperability. Zigbee, EnOcean, Z-wave, and Wi-Fi provide wireless communication across various equipment of smart homes; however, system manufacturers turn to Zigbee for the purpose of wireless communications most of the time. The best system would be one that supports high data throughput for streaming applications, allows intermittent bursts of small packets of sensor data, consumes enough energy to support high throughput, and supports low-power applications. The security would be provided by the encryption of the signals. Similarly, the network architecture would accommodate a considerable number of systems whereby the user can add new devices with ease. The sad thing is that there is a miss of at least one interoperability standard to address all the needs for the system performance.\n",

Retrofit installations offer convenience in terms of making a home smart without major renovations. This would support gradual and more personalized smart home uptake, where users could add features in line with needs and budget. Retrofitting will therefore be a basis for the implementation of smart systems, such as lighting, security, heating, and cooling in old buildings, to make them more efficient and convenient. The trend is fueled by demands for more comfort, higher security, and better energy management without interfering with the original structure or disrupting operations unnecessarily.\n",
      "By product, the smart kitchen segment is expected to grow with the highest CAGR in 2029.\n",
      "The smart kitchen segment is expected to register a growth of 11.7% in the CAGR.

Exhaustive secondary research has been carried out to collect information on the market, the peer markets, and the parent market. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches have been employed to estimate the total market size. Market breakdown and data triangulation methods have also been used to estimate the market for segments and subsegments.\n",
      "Secondary Research\n",
      "Revenues of companies offering data center accelerator systems have been obtained from the secondary data available through paid and unpaid sources. The revenues have also been derived by analyzing the product portfolio of key companies, and these companies have been rated according to the performance and quality of their products.\n",
      "In the secondary research process, various sources have been referred to for identifying and collecting information for this study on the smart home market. Secondary sources considered for this research study include government sources, corporate filings, and trade, business, and professional associations. Secondary data has been collected and analyzed to arrive at the overall market size, which has been further validated through primary research.\n",
      "Secondary research has been mainly used to obtain key information about the supply chain of data center accelerator systems to identify key players based on their products and prevailing industry trends in the smart home market by product, offering, sales channel, and installation type, and region. Secondary research also helped obtain market information- and technology-oriented key developments undertaken by market players to expand their presence and increase their market share.\n",

      "Market Size Estimation\n",
      "The bottom-up approach has been employed to arrive at the overall size of the smart home market from the revenues of key players and their share. Calculations based on revenues of the key players identified in the market led to the estimation of the market’s overall size.\n",
      "Approach to arrive at market size using bottom-up analysis (demand side)\n",
      "Initially, over 25 companies offering smart home solutions were identified. Their offerings were mapped based on products, software, and services.\n",
      "After understanding the different types of smart homes offered by various manufacturers, the market was categorized into different segments based on the data gathered through primary and secondary sources.\n",
      "To derive the global smart home market, global shipments of top players for each smart home device that were considered in the scope of the report were tracked.\n",
      "A suitable penetration rate was assigned for each product type to derive the shipments of smart homes.\n",
      "We derived the smart home market based on different product types using the average selling price (ASP) at which a particular company offers its devices. The ASP of each device was identified based on secondary sources and validated from primaries.\n",
      "For the projected market values of each device type, the Y-o-Y projections showed a steep growth initially until 2023. The market is expected to witness a sharp ascent after that, considering the demand for smart homes for different applications.\n",
      "For the CAGR, the market trend analysis was carried out by understanding the industry penetration rate and the demand and supply of smart homes in different applications.\n",
      "The smart home market is also tracked through the data sanity method. The revenues of over 25 key providers were analyzed through annual reports and press releases and summed to derive the overall market.\n",
      "For each company, a percentage is assigned to its overall revenue or, in a few cases, segmental revenue to derive its revenue for the smart home. This percentage for each company is assigned based on its product portfolio and range of smart home offerings.\n",
      "The estimates at every level have been verified and cross-checked by discussing them with key opinion leaders, including CXOs, directors, and operation managers, and finally, with the domain experts at MarketsandMarkets.\n",
      "Various paid and unpaid sources of information, such as annual reports, press releases, white papers, and databases, have been studied’\n",

      "The growth of the smart home market witnessed an upward trend during the studied period, as it is currently in the initial stage of the product cycle, with major players beginning to expand their business into various application areas of the market.\n",
      "Types of smart homes, their features and properties, geographical presence, and key applications served by all players in the smart home market were studied to estimate and arrive at the percentage split of the segments.\n",
      "Different types of smart homes and their penetration for products were also studied.\n",
      "Based on secondary research, the market split for smart homes by sales channel, offering, and installation type was estimated.\n",
      "Multiple discussions with key opinion leaders across major companies involved in developing the smart home and related components were conducted to validate the market split of sales channel, offering, and installation type.\n",
      "The regional splits were estimated using secondary sources based on factors such as the number of players in a specific country and region and the adoption and use cases of each implementation type with respect to products in the region.\n",
      "Data Triangulation\n",
      "After arriving at the overall market size-using the market size estimation processes as explained above-the market has been split into several segments and subsegments. To complete the entire market engineering process and arrive at the exact statistics of each market segment and subsegment, data triangulation and market breakdown procedures have been employed, wherever applicable. The data has been triangulated by studying various factors and trends from the demand and supply sides in the smart home market.\n",
      "Market Definition\n",
      "A smart home is incorporated with advanced automation systems that enable inhabitants to monitor and control the functions of the house. Smart home systems enable owners to control lights, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), security alarms, and other household devices remotely through their smartphones, tablets, or computers. Smart homes are equipped with wired and wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, universal powerline bus (UPB), Insteon, Z-Wave, and Zigbee to offer intelligent insights and details to homeowners by continuously monitoring various aspects of the homes. As part of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart home systems and devices often operate together, sharing consumer usage data and automating actions based on homeowners’ preferences.\n",
      "According to Smart Home Energy, an association in the UK, smart homes use home automation technologies to provide homeowners with intelligent feedback and information by monitoring many aspects of a home. For example, a smart home’s refrigerator may be able to catalog its contents, suggest menus, recommend healthy alternatives, and order replacements as food is used up.\n",

      "There’s no denying that we live in the age of the smart home. While many homes still do not have built-in smart features, the trend is on the rise, so prepare to see smart tech in brand new builds as well as part of reno projects to existing homes this year. Last year, trends like touchless doorbells and smart thermostats were all the rage. This year, smart tech has gotten that much smarter, and so have integrations into homes.\n",
      "Here are the top five smart home trends to check out this year.\n",

      "Top 5 Smart Home Trends of 2024\n",
      "1. Appliances With Connected Technology\n",
      "Digital refrigerators aren’t necessarily new, but the trend is going strong into 2024 with even more connectivity options and features.\n",
      "Jessica McConnell, director of color, material & finish and product graphics, and global consumer design at Whirlpool Corporation, said that consumers are seeking convenience more than ever when it comes to kitchen appliances. “[There are new] appliances that improve life at home through purposeful, connected features like pre-programmed settings that automatically adjust cooking times and connected apps that send cooking instructions straight to the oven [making] everyday tasks more seamless.”\n",
      "McConnell also said that brands are creating appliances that get smarter over time to “enhance performance and provide consumers with new features and cooking methods. Through connected technologies, we’re able to help consumers make cooking and cleaning more intuitive.”\n",
      "2. Smart Showers\n",
      "Credit: Delta\n",
      "Customized digital showers are going to be huge this year among many top brands.\n",
      "Alex Yacavone, design studio manager of trends and CMF at Kohler said that “2024 has been coined ‘the year of the shower.’” This claim is shared by Pinterest’s recent insights into customizable showers as a major 2024 trend.\n",
      "Clinton Cardinal, manager of the showering category at Brizo, agrees. “There are many options in the market offering a variety of different benefits, but consumer favorites tend to feature a smartphone app to offer the user access to warm-up modes, user presets and more,” he told Forbes Home. “This ensures the user spends more time doing what they want rather than waiting around in the bathroom for the shower to warm up.”\n",
      "Not only are connectivity options big among smart showers this year, but more importantly, ultimate customization, including user profiles with multiple presets to control elements like temperature, duration, flow and even optional audiotherapy, chromotherapy and aromatherapy. Yes, you read that correctly—aromatherapy in your shower.\n",
      "Cardinal also said that up-and-coming smart showers will feature “built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to connect to virtual home assistants to control your shower with voice activation” and connect to your favorite music or audio apps.\n",

      "Get prequalified in minutes by clicking on your state.\n",
      "\t\t\tLearn More\n",
      "3. Touchless Faucets\n",
      "Touchless faucets are the unsung heroes of every kitchen with a messy chef. Not only are they helpful for dirty hands, but Brizo’s Cardinal told Forbes Home that they can even promote hygiene and water conservation.\n",
      "“The touchless feature allows you to interact with your faucet without touching the same handle you used when your hands were dirty, and the faucet is also smart enough to understand when you are near versus far,” Cardinal said. “This allows you to conserve water when doing daily tasks like brushing teeth or washing hands by simply moving away from the faucet.”\n",
      "4. Smart Toilets\n",
      "Kohler\n",
      "Gone are the days of the basic toilet. Kohler’s Yacavone told Forbes Home that “smart toilets are fully mainstream at this point, with a desire for designs that are sleeker,” and in multiple colors besides white. Bidets are also making a major entrance into the U.S. market.\n",
      "Danielle DeBoe Harper, senior creative style manager at Moen, said that this year, you can expect to see bidet seat integrations and electronic toilets in more markets and homes. Soon, you’ll be able to choose from products that, according to Harper, will have “features ranging from instantaneous warm water to warm air drying and hands-free operation,” and that there is a model to suit any need, preference and budget.\n",
      "5. Eco-Conscious Smart Water Networks\n",
      "Eco-friendly practices are going hand-in-hand with smart home trends this year, which in itself is an encouraging trend. Mason Hall, head of connected products and fortune brands innovations at Moen, told Forbes Home that smart tech for water products will be a major 2024 trend.\n",

      "THIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

We do not present information about every offer available. The information and savings numbers depicted above are for demonstration purposes only, and your results may vary.\n",
      "Is Your Home In Need Of A Bathroom Remodel?\n",
      "Let your bathroom reflect your personality. Design a bathroom of your style with top-rated bathroom remodelers from Bath&ShowerPros.\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\tExplore Options\n",
      "“Much of the home’s water usage is due to outdoor irrigation,” Hall said. And that upcoming smart water networks including sprinkler controllers and wireless soil sensors will “take the guesswork out of lawncare and only water your yard when and where it’s needed, with features such as scheduling, independent zone control and weather skip.”\n",
      "With these new features installed in your home, Hall said that “users now have total control of water both in and outside of their homes, and can develop better habits to further their impact on today’s environment.”\n",
      "Bottom Line\n",
      "Whether you want to take on a smaller project like switching out faucets or a much larger undertaking like installing smart showers, you have plenty of options at your disposal to elevate your home with smart tech. Not only can these features look sleek, but they can also help run the routines and rituals of your home with timers and customized profiles. These smart home trends are usually worth the money and just might inspire you to digitize your home ASAP.\n",

      "**Title: Top 5 Smart Home Trends to Elevate Your Life in 2024**\n",
      "\n",
      "Welcome to the future of living with SmartHome 360! As we gear up for the launch of our latest product, we are excited to share the top smart home trends that are set to revolutionize your home in 2024. From connected appliances to eco-conscious water networks, these innovations are designed to make your life more convenient, efficient, and enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Appliances With Connected Technology**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine a kitchen where your refrigerator can suggest recipes based on its contents, and your oven preheats itself just in time for dinner. Connected kitchen appliances are here to make your culinary adventures more seamless. With features like pre-programmed settings and apps that send cooking instructions straight to your oven, cooking has never been easier or more intuitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Smart Showers**\n",
      "\n",
      "2024 is the year of the smart shower! Customized digital showers are taking personalization to the next level. With options for user presets, temperature control, and even audiotherapy, chromotherapy, and aromatherapy, your shower experience will be more relaxing and tailored to your preferences. Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity mean you can control your shower with voice commands or through your favorite music apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Touchless Faucets**\n",
      "\n",
      "Say goodbye to messy handles and hello to touchless faucets. These innovative devices not only promote hygiene by allowing you to operate them without touching the handle but also help conserve water. With sensors that detect your presence, touchless faucets ensure that water is used efficiently, making daily tasks like brushing teeth or washing hands more eco-friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Smart Toilets**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gone are the days of the basic toilet. Smart toilets are now fully mainstream, offering features like bidet seat integrations, instantaneous warm water, warm air drying, and hands-free operation. Available in various designs and colors, these toilets cater to different needs, preferences, and budgets, enhancing your bathroom experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Eco-Conscious Smart Water Networks**\n",
      "\n",
      "Eco-friendly practices are becoming a significant trend in smart home technology. Smart water networks, including sprinkler controllers and wireless soil sensors, take the guesswork out of lawn care. These systems water your yard only when and where it's needed, helping you conserve water and develop better environmental habits.\n",
